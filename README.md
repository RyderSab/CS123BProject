# Fine Needle Aspirates and Machine Learning for Tumor Diagnosis

## ℹ️ Overview
This project was written as part of a final project for my bioinformatics course exploring how machine learning can be used to deepen our understanding/analysis of biological data as well as serving as a chance to learn how certain machine learning algorithms work through implementation. 

For my topic, I chose to explore the use of machine learning techniques to predict tumor malignancy from the data of fine needle aspirates, while learning how decision trees and random forest classifers work. To that end, this project features my own implementation of both a decision tree classifier and a random forest classifer and which explores how effective machine learning can be at determining tumor malignancies and whether fine needle aspirates can be a viable alternative to
