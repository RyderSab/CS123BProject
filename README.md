# Fine Needle Aspirates and Machine Learning for Tumor Diagnosis
___
This project was written as part of a final project for my bioinformatics course exploring how machine learning can be used to deepen our understanding/analysis of biological data as well as serving as a chance to learn how certain machine learning algorithms work through implementation. 

## ℹ️ Overview
___
For my project, I chose to explore the use of machine learning techniques to predict tumor malignancy from the data of fine needle aspirates, while learning how decision trees and random forest classifiers work. To that end, this project features my own implementation of both a decision tree classifier and a random forest classifier. 

These classifier work with numeric values and are currently capable of binary classification.

*As of this current version (1.0), model evaluation is not implicitly implemented; however, model accuracy, runtime, and false positive/negative rate are available.*
